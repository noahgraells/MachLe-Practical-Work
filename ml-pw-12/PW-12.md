### Noise of 0.9

### Question 3

We can see that the model becomes really good at denoising. It is difficult for the human eye de know what number is hiding behind behind a noise of 0.9, but the model is able to determine it.

### Question 4

We can see that the more samples we take, the blurrier the images generated are, but with 10 samples, it is quite difficult to say that the generated number is 2 (kind of look like an 'a').

It would be possible to measure the diversity by calculating the average difference between the elements.

### Question 5

We can see that for the generation of 2 with only 10 samples, some 2 are classified as '3' (green) or '4' (red).

Similarly for the predictions of 8, we can see that multiples 8 are classified as '3',  some as '1' (yellow) and one has been classified as '5' (the blue one).
